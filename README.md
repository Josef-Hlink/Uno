A terminal Uno game that can be played with multiple people on one laptop, or against bots.

About
---

Development (mainly together with one collaborator) was done on GitLab, hence the large initial commit.

Dependencies
---

Only `Python 3.9` or higher, no further dependencies.

Instructions
---

Clone the repo, and simply run `main.py` in a terminal with height 40 and width 112.
Larger is also okay, but this creates the best experience.
